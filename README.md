# Lukas' Project Portforlio Page
Please visit my Github pages project portfolio. You can browse a selection of my projects that I have posed online, and you can even test some of the code out for yourself.
My projects are focused arourd web development and data science. 

This page will be evolving over the next few months as a work to complete a proffessional programming certification from MIT. With this, the data science and web development parts
of my work will become more and more intergrated.

enjoy!
